Hello! Welcome to the BETASQUAD Basketball Trade Optimizer! I will give you a quick run through of what our code does and
how to best use it.

IMPORTANT FILES
    All of the final drafts of our code are in the Cluster folder, which is located in the website folder.


    The important files are final.py, represent.py, julian_waugh_crawler.py (I am a narcissist), slections.py, and trader.py.

    In the crawler, we gather all of our data (something we have to do frequently since NBA statistics are updated on a day to day basis).
    We eliminate players who were waived and we handle the multiplicity that comes from players being traded. Our goal is to generate
    two dictionaries - return_dict and roster_dict that describe statistics and individual player links for each player respectively.
    We scrape the statistics pages, roster pages, and individual player data pages of realgm.com.

    In represent.py, we have our clustering code, which is capable of clustering the league into 5 positions based on statistics,
    generating plots for a player comparing him to his respective centroid, and returning the position of a player.

    In trader.py, we have code that builds dataframes out of the scraped data, and our trade function.

    In selections.py, we apply the constraints to a league dataframe to get the players that match the user input.

    final.py is where we put everything together using the GM class, which builds the clusters and is capable of running a trade.
